Project Description:

Given the fictional database Northwind Products, a colleague and I undertook the task to translate this dimensional data store into a ROLAP star-schema implementation, and to populate it with sample data.

Instructions:
WORK IN PROGRESS.  The query files we wrote to implement the solution to the problem are provided; however, I have not yet obtained permission to include the Northwind database in this repository.

Thanks for taking the time to view my project.
